# public/images

Binary image assets are intentionally excluded in this environment.

## Images referenced by the UI
- `/images/logo-reel-round.svg` (branding navbar + footer + app icons)
- `/images/DSC08797-Edit-scaled.jpg` (about + executive)
- `/images/DSC08898-Edit-scaled.jpg` (events + executive)
- `/images/DSC08963-scaled.jpg` (events + heritage + executive)
- `/images/MMP03629-scaled.jpg` (executive)
- `/images/Sans-titre-7.png` (homepage hero)
- `/images/TROUVE-TON-COFOUN-3-1024x1024.png` (events)

## Missing assets in this repo clone
All files above are currently missing from this environment (only `.gitkeep` + this README are present).

The UI now attempts to load those image paths directly and falls back to a styled placeholder when a file is unavailable.
